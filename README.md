# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Company Brochure Generator

This project is an intelligent brochure-generation tool powered by LLMs like **OpenAI GPT** and **Ollama**. You simply provide the **company name** and **landing page URL**, and it returns a well-structured, markdown-formatted **marketing brochure** for use in customer engagement, investor presentations, or recruitment campaigns.

> Itâ€™s not just scraping and summarizing â€” this app **identifies the most relevant sections** of a companyâ€™s website (like *About*, *Careers*, etc.) and synthesizes them into a professional brochure using AI.

## Features

- Scrapes and cleans content from the provided company website
- Uses LLMs to **identify relevant sub-pages** (About, Company, Careers)
- Generates an insightful, short-form **company brochure in Markdown**
- Supports both **OpenAI GPT** and **local Ollama models** (like `llama3.2`)
- Simple and intuitive **Gradio-based web interface**

## How It Works

1. **Input:** You enter a company name and website URL.
2. **Scraping:** The app scrapes visible text content (excluding scripts, styles, forms, etc.).
3. **Link Filtering via LLM:** It uses an LLM to extract only meaningful links (e.g., About, Careers).
4. **Deep Dive:** It scrapes those additional pages.
5. **Brochure Generation:** It combines all content and prompts the LLM to write a high-level company overview.

##### Make sure you have configured the API (in a ".env" file in the root directory) for using the OpenAI model.
##### Also you should install Ollama on your machine.

## LLM Providers

| **OLLAMA** (local) | Uses a local Ollama model (like `llama3.2`) via HTTP API on `localhost:11434` |

> You can toggle between the models using the dropdown in the Gradio interface.
